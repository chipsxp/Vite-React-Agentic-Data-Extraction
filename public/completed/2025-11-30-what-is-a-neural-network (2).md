<::A diagram of a neuron. It shows a central cell body with dendrites branching out. A nucleus is visible within the cell body. Extending from the cell body is a long axon, which is partially covered by segmented myelin sheaths. The axon terminates in several branches, each ending in a synaptic button, all enclosed within a light gray oval representing the synaptic region.: figure::>

<::A diagram of a neural network titled "Layers". The diagram shows four vertical sections, each representing a layer. From left to right: The first section, colored yellow, is labeled "Input" at the bottom and contains one white circular node. The second section, colored red, is labeled "hidden" at the bottom and contains three white circular nodes stacked vertically. The third section, also colored red, is labeled "hidden" at the bottom and also contains three white circular nodes stacked vertically. The fourth section, colored green, is labeled "output" at the bottom and contains one white circular node. Arrows indicate connections between nodes: The input node connects to all three nodes in the first hidden layer. Each node in the first hidden layer connects to all three nodes in the second hidden layer. All three nodes in the second hidden layer connect to the single output node.

<::A diagram of a neuron, colored yellow, with a purple nucleus in the center of its cell body. Dendrites, depicted as thin orange branches, extend from the cell body and terminate in light blue bulb-like structures. An axon, colored light blue, extends from one side of the cell body and contains a purple oval structure within it. This axon also branches into light blue bulb-like structures. The neuron is outlined in black.: figure::>

1. Receives inputs
2. Multiplies inputs by a random weight
3. Adds a bias to account for inputs of o
4. Passes inputs to an activation function to

What do you do with the output?

<a id='5aca52d6-1b00-4670-a72f-1aaf292d1bac'></a>

1. Compare the output to a known label
2. Adjust weight accordingly
3. Repeat until there are no more allowed
iterations or the error rate is acceptable

<::A chart displaying three activation functions. The chart is divided into three subplots, each with an X-axis labeled "X" and a Y-axis labeled "Y". The X-axis for all plots ranges from -3 to 3.

1.  **tanh()**: This subplot shows the hyperbolic tangent function in blue with circular markers. The Y-axis ranges from -1.00 to 1.00. The curve starts near (-3, -1), passes through (0, 0), and approaches (3, 1), demonstrating a smooth S-shaped curve.
2.  **Relu**: This subplot shows the Rectified Linear Unit function in orange with circular markers. The Y-axis ranges from 0.0 to 3.0. The line is flat at Y=0 for X values less than or equal to 0, and then increases linearly with a slope of 1 for X values greater than 0, starting from (0, 0) and reaching (3, 3).
3.  **Leaky Relu**: This subplot shows the Leaky Rectified Linear Unit function in green with circular markers. The Y-axis ranges from -0.5 to 3.0. The line shows a small positive slope for X values less than or equal to 0 (e.g., at X=-3, Y is approximately -0.3 to -0.4), and then increases linearly with a slope of 1 for X values greater than 0, starting from (0, 0) and reaching (3, 3).
