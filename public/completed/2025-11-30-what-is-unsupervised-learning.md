<::A scatter plot with numerous yellow data points distributed across the center. A white L-shaped arrow system indicates axes, with one arrow pointing upwards and another pointing to the right. Two additional arrows originate from the approximate center of the data cluster: one red arrow points diagonally upwards and to the left, and one blue arrow points diagonally upwards and to the right, appearing to represent principal components or eigenvectors relative to the data distribution.

<::A scatter plot shows a cloud of numerous yellow data points. A white x-axis and y-axis form a coordinate system. Two principal component vectors are drawn from the center of the data cloud: one red arrow pointing diagonally up and to the left, and one light blue arrow pointing diagonally up and to the right, roughly aligned with the elongation of the data cloud.

<::Cluster Analysis: A scatter plot on a black background shows data points distributed across a two-dimensional space. An x-axis and y-axis are present, indicated by white lines forming an L-shape in the bottom left, with an arrow pointing upwards along the y-axis. The data points are colored and grouped into three distinct clusters, each enclosed by an oval outline:
- A cluster of white data points, enclosed by a light grey oval, is located in the upper right quadrant.
- A cluster of yellow (gold) data points, enclosed by a yellow oval, is located in the bottom left quadrant.
- A cluster of red data points, enclosed by a red oval, is located in the bottom right quadrant. There are also a few scattered red data points outside of the red oval in the bottom right corner.: figure::>
