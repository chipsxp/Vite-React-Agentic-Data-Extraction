<::A cartoon illustration shows a large, blocky robot with antennas and simple facial features. Its light blue torso has the text "TEACH . O . BOT 3000" written on it. Openings on either side of its torso show yellow cables or ribbons. Several smaller, rectangular, computer-like figures with simple faces interact with the large robot, appearing to feed it yellow cables or cards. One small figure on the left plugs a yellow cable into the robot's side, while another on the far left carries a cable. On the right, two small figures stand near the robot, one holding a yellow object towards it. The scene is set above a yellow bar at the bottom: illustration::>

<::An illustration of a robot. The robot has a dark blue rectangular body with yellow limbs. Its head is yellow and oval-shaped with a light blue face and two small dark blue eyes. Its right arm is raised with a yellow claw-like hand. Its left arm is bent at the elbow, also ending in a yellow claw-like hand. The robot stands on a yellow base with dark blue accents. The base has two horizontal lines, a circular blue element, and vertical grill-like lines on the right side.

<::The Python programming language logo, which consists of two stylized, rounded snake heads intertwined. The upper snake is blue and faces left, with a white eye dot. The lower snake is yellow and faces right, also with a white eye dot. The two shapes are mirrored and interlock to form the complete logo.
